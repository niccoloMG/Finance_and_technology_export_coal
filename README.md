## Abstract
New coal-fired power plants largely depend on international debt financing. Here, we aim to understand the underlying reasons why public and private actors finance coal plants overseas. We construct a novel dataset that links debt transactions to individual power plant units, including information on involved companies such as equipment manufacturers and service providers. We find that cross-border financing primarily stems from public sector banks in China, Japan and South Korea, as well as from private banks in Japan, Singapore and the UK. Financing from public banks is accompanied by technology exports from the same country. For private financing this holds true only for Japan. Semi-structured interviews highlight that demand from host countries is crucial for the realization of new coal plants. Financing countries seize this opportunity to support their domestic industry to go abroad. Policies tackling coal globally thus should consider the political economy in financing and host countries.
